# First to 100 game

A game that can be played by two players.

Rules:
When it's your turn after you roll the dice you can choose to either keep the score and add it to the total points, or roll again and add the points.
If you roll one you current points will reset and it's your opponent's turn.
The first one who reaches 100 points wins.

Good luck!
